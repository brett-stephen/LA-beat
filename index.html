                    Regina born, Vancouver based “country/soul” singer Jojo Mason is all about the good vibes with a little bit of good luck and good timing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Mason never even thought of being a singer. He wanted to be a professional hockey player and moved out to Victoria to play junior hockey until he injured himself. However a fortuitous meeting at a party with producer Dan Schwimmer who was struggling with a line in a song about drinking moonshine out of a Mason’s jar, until he met Mason, who was doing just that.

                    <p>
                    They struck up a quick rapport and friendship and Schwimmer ended up taking Mason under his wing.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Now Mason has released his debut hit album “Both Sides of the Bar”  and several  hit singles including “It’s All Good,” “Good Kind of Love” and “Red Dress” and has begun a tour with country stars the James Barker band and Meghan Patrick, who stop by Average Joes, Feb. 3.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                     “It’s going great brother,” rumbled Mason from Halifax, where they just kicked off the cross Canada tour.   
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    “The first show was sold out. It was crazy. I couldn’t have asked for a better start to the tour,” he enthused, noting he is excited to have 20 minutes to be opening for the rising stars.
                        “I’ve never played with them before. This is my first tour and they’ve been so generous,” Mason continued.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Mason has been pleasantly surprised  by the success of his debut CD, having carefully chosen which songs he wanted to record for it.
                        “Dan has a lot of songs to choose from,” Mason observed, adding it was easy to choose the ones that resonated the most with him.
                    </p>
